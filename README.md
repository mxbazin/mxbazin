# Hi 👋, I'm Maxime Bazin

Graduate student in Mechanical Engineering at the University of Michigan,  
with a strong focus on **computational fluid dynamics, numerical methods, and physics-based simulation**.

While my coursework is centered on CFD and numerical methods, my research work
is experimental, focusing on PIV-based flow control.

---

## 🔭 Current focus
- Numerical methods for CFD (projection methods, multigrid, stability)
- Experimental flow control using PIV-based flow diagnostics

---

## 👨‍💻 Selected projects
- **Incompressible Navier–Stokes solver**  
  2D finite-volume solver on staggered grids using a projection method  
- **Shallow Water Equations solver**  
  Finite-volume solver on unstructured meshes with Roe and Rusanov fluxes  
- **Centrifugal pump CFD + cardiovascular modeling**  
  RANS simulations coupled with a lumped heart model in OpenModelica
